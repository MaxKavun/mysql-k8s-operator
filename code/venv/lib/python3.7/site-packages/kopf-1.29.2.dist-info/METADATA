**Kopf** —Kubernetes Operator Pythonic Framework— is a framework and a library
to make Kubernetes operators development easier, just in a few lines of Python code. 

The main goal is to bring the Domain-Driven Design to the infrastructure level,
with Kubernetes being an orchestrator/database of the domain objects (custom resources),
and the operators containing the domain logic (with no or minimal infrastructure logic).

The project was originally started as `zalando-incubator/kopf` in March 2019,
and then forked as `nolar/kopf` in August 2020: but it is the same codebase,
the same packages, the same developer(s).


## Documentation

* https://kopf.readthedocs.io/


## Features

* Simple, but powerful:
  * A full-featured operator in just 2 files: a `Dockerfile` + a Python file (*).
  * Handling functions registered via decorators with declarative approach. 
  * No infrastructure boilerplate code with K8s API communication.
  * Both sync and async handlers, with sync ones being threaded under the hood.
  * Detailed documentation with examples.
* Intuitive mapping of Python concepts to Kubernetes concepts and back:
  * Marshalling of resources' data to the handlers' kwargs.
  * Marshalling of handlers' results to the resources' statuses.
  * Publishing of logging messages as Kubernetes events linked to the resources.
* Support anything that exists in K8s:
  * Custom K8s resources, obviously.
  * Builtin K8s resources (pods, namespaces, etc).
  * Multiple resource types in one operator.
  * Both cluster and namespaced operators.
* All the ways of handling that a developer can wish for:
  * Low-level handlers for events received from K8s APIs "as is" (an equivalent of _informers_).
  * High-level handlers for detected causes of changes (creation, updates with diffs, deletion).
  * Handling of selected fields only instead of the whole objects (if needed).
  * Dynamically generated or conditional sub-handlers (an advanced feature).
  * Timers that tick as long as the resource exists, optionally with a delay since the last change.
  * Daemons that run as long as the resource exists (in threads or asyncio-tasks).
  * Filtering with stealth mode (no logging): by arbitrary filtering functions,
    by labels/annotations with values, presence/absence, or dynamic callbacks.
  * In-memory all-purpose containers to store non-serializable objects for individual resources.
* Eventual consistency of handling:
  * Retrying the handlers in case of arbitrary errors until they succeed.
  * Special exceptions to request a special retry or to never retry again.
  * Custom limits for the number of attempts or the time.
  * Implicit persistence of the progress that survives the operator restarts.
  * Tolerance to restarts and lengthy downtimes: handles the changes afterwards.
* Awareness of other Kopf-based operators:
  * Configurable identities for different Kopf-based operators for the same resource kinds.
  * Avoiding of double-processing due to cross-pod awareness of the same operator ("peering").
  * Pausing of a deployed operator when a dev-mode operator runs outside of the cluster.
* Extra toolkits and integrations:
  * Some limited support for object hierarchies with name/labels propagation.
  * Friendly to any K8s client libraries (and is client agnostic).
  * Startup/cleanup operator-level handlers.
  * Liveness probing endpoints and rudimentary metrics exports.
  * Basic testing toolkit for in-memory per-test operator running.
  * Embeddable into other Python applications.
* Highly configurable (to some reasonable extent).

(*) _Small font: two files of the operator itself, plus some amount of
deployment files like RBAC roles, bindings, service accounts, network policies
— everything needed to deploy an application in your specific infrastructure._


## Examples

See [examples](https://github.com/nolar/kopf/tree/master/examples)
for the examples of the typical use-cases.

A minimalistic operator can look like this:

```python
import kopf

@kopf.on.create('kopfexamples')
def create_fn(spec, name, meta, status, **kwargs):
    print(f"And here we are! Created {name} with spec: {spec}")
```

Numerous kwargs are available, such as `body`, `meta`, `spec`, `status`,
`name`, `namespace`, `retry`, `diff`, `old`, `new`, `logger`, etc: 
see [Arguments](https://kopf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kwargs/)

To run a non-exiting function for every resource as long as it exists:

```python
import time
import kopf

@kopf.daemon('kopfexamples')
def my_daemon(spec, stopped, **kwargs):
    while not stopped:
        print(f"Object's spec: {spec}")
        time.sleep(1)
```

Or the same with the timers:

```python
import kopf

@kopf.timer('kopfexamples', interval=1)
def my_timer(spec, **kwargs):
    print(f"Object's spec: {spec}")
```

That easy! For more features, see the [documentation](https://kopf.readthedocs.io/).


## Usage

We assume that when the operator is executed in the cluster, it must be packaged
into a docker image with CI/CD tool of your preference.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.7
ADD . /src
RUN pip install kopf
CMD kopf run /src/handlers.py --verbose
```

Where `handlers.py` is your Python script with the handlers
(see `examples/*/example.py` for the examples).

See `kopf run --help` for others ways of attaching the handlers.
